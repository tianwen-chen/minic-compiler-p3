1. Each file in this directory has an optimized (suffix _opt) version and unoptimized 
LLVM file for each program.

2. For files cfold* and p2_common_subexpr files only local optimizations were turned on
so no constants are propagated.

3. For files p4*, p5* and p6* both local and global optimizations were turned on.
4. Files p4, p5, and p6 test different scenarios to be handles in constant propagation.
